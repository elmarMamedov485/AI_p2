## Description

The project solves n-Queens problem using CSP backtracking algorithm. Several heuristics are used: MRV, LCV. The project also implements AC-3 both for preprocessing and for usage during search. Additionally, forward checking is implemented. Despite all, the algorithm struggles to solve instances for n > 100. For this reason, min-conflicts alorithm is also provided.
